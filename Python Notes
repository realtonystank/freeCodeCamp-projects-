ðŸ˜€ ## Different ways to concatenate strings in python:
     Context: Suppose there is a variable with name youtuber and you wish to print "Subscribe to ________" where in place of dashes you want to print the youtuber's name.
      You can do so in following ways:
          i.   print("Subscribe to "+youtuber)
          ii.  print("Subscribe to {}".format(youtuber))
          iii. print(f"Subscribe to {youtuber}")
   
   ## To select a random integer in a range:
      Use random library function randint
        Syntax: random.randint(1,10) // selects a random integer in range [1,10]
      
   ## To select a random element from a list and other sequence types
     Use random library function choice
        Syntax: random.choice(['r','p','s']) // selects a random element from list
